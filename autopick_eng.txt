# autopick.txt for Hengband
#
# The last part of this file is an example of 'pickpref.prf'. 
# You can copy this file to lib\user\ or ~/.angband/Hengband/ 
# to use as preference of auto-picker.
# (UNIX user must copy to ~/.angband/Hengband/. Others must 
# copy to lib\user\ .)
#
#    =====   How to use auto-picker/destroyer   ========
#    
#     Press the _ in a game to enter editor mode for preference of
#     auto-picker/destroyer.  Basic usage of the editor is almost same
#     as vi, and also have emacs like commands.  Most commands is
#     always displayed on the first line and the right half of the
#     screen.
#
#     Important commands 
#      'a', 'i' or ^Q :  Enter insert mode from command mode
#      ESC  or ^Q     :  Return to command mode from insert mode
#      'q'            :  Quit the editor (command mode only)
#      'hjkl2468'     :  Move cursor (command mode only)
#      ^B ^N ^P ^F    :  Move cursor (always)
#      ^I  : Choose an item from inventry/equipment, then insert its name
#      ^S  : Rotates action (pick up / destroy / leave on floor)
#      ^U  : Rotates idendify state (identified / unidentified / ...)
#      ^L  : Insert name of the last auto-destroyed item.
#      '/' : Search string, or search an item specified by ^I or ^L.
#      'n' : Search next
#      'N' : Search previous
#
#      The preference will be saved in a file named
#      "pickpref-<<name>>.prf" in your user directory; This will be
#      ~/.angband/Hengband/ for UNIX, or hengband\lib\user\ for other
#      operating systems.  You may edit this file using any text
#      editor, and may use the '$' command within the game to reread
#      this file.  When you don't use the in-game editor, you may use
#      "pickpref.prf" as preference file.
#
#      When there are both files, the game will read the file
#      "pickpref-<<current character name>>.prf" first and then read
#      the file "pickpref.prf".  The first-read file takes priority.
#
#      Notes:
#      Maximum number of active lines is 1009.
#      A line with a header '#' is a comment.
#
#
#    Editing the file
#    ---------
#
#    Command letter:
#           Each line determines the actions taken when you step over a kind 
#      of object.  Starting a line with '!' indicates that you wish to destroy 
#      this kind of object.  Starting a line with '~' indicates that you wish 
#      to leave this kind of object on the floor.  Otherwise, your character 
#      will automatically attempt to pick up the object.
#           There is an additional command letter '('.  It indicates that 
#      you don't wish this item to be displayed in full map. see below.
#
#      Notes:
#      If you want to disable the effect of the '!' indicator temporally, 
#      use 'always_pickup' option.
#
#

#    Special Notes:

#      Lines will be evaluated in order, and first matched line will be 
#      applied. So you can write names of specific excellent items to pick 
#      up, followed by a general item name with '!' to destroy useless items.
#    
#      ! Tips
#      !     In full map command ('M'), you can press M, N, K, or D to 
#      ! display locations of items for auto-pickup, leaving, auto-destroy 
#      ! or both auto-pickup and leaving.
#      !     Additional command letter '(' prevents this display.
#      !
#
#      If you begin the last string in a line with '#', this string will
#      be automatically inscribed on the item.
#
#
#      Strict syntax of each line is below.

#    =======  How to use Conditional Expressions  ========
#    
#      The lines of pickpref.prf can be disabled/enabled using 
#      conditional expressions. 
#      The syntax is the same as that of other preference files.
#    
#      - usage of condition expressions
#        ?:expr
#          If result of expr is "0", all lines below are disabled.
#          If result of expr is "1", all lines below are enabled.
#          Caution:It cannot be nested.
#    
#      - usage to include other file
#        %:filename
#          Read a file named 'filename' as a new pick-pref file. The file 
#          must be in the user directory.
#          Caution: Avoid naming the parent file, or the game might freeze up.
#    
#      - usage of operators

#          If all args are same, returns "1", or else returns "0".
#        [IOR arg1 arg2 ...]

#        [NOT arg]
#          Returns "0" if arg is "1", or else returns "1"
#        [LEQ arg1 arg2 ...]
#        [GEQ arg1 arg2 ...]
#          Compare args as string. LEQ returns "1" if (arg1 <= arg2 <= ...) ,
